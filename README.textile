.h1 generate domain weights

Lin, Kui, Zhu and Zhang developed a similarity measure for protein domain architectures. This is based on precomputed 'domain weights'. The 'generate_domain_weights' tool computes the domain weights of all InterPro annotations in UniprotKB in parallel using R and redis.
