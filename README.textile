h1. generate domain weights

Lee, Byungwook, and Doheon Lee developed a similarity measure for protein domain architectures. This is based on precomputed 'domain weights'. The 'generate_domain_weights' tool computes these domain weights for all InterPro annotations in UniprotKB in parallel using R and redis.
